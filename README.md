ðŸš€ This project implements predictive modeling techniques to forecast Tesla's stock prices using three different machine learning models: Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gradient Boosting. However, with a bit of an edit and importation of a proper dataset, this model can be used with any stock. The model produced an average of 80% accuracy, ensuring no over-fitting and a learning technique rather than a memorizing one.

ðŸ“„ A document can be found in the main branch diving deeper into the results of the predictive models, an explanation of how they work, and my overall reasoning for them. Furthermore, I explain my non-technical approach, epxloring SQL to highlight important dates and further researching these days to understand the reason for certain spikes and dips.
