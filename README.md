Overview

The goal of this project is to compare different machine learning techniques for stock price prediction and analyze their effectiveness. The models were trained and tested using historical stock data of Tesla (TSLA) to forecast future stock prices.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM implementation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of historical Tesla stock prices, retrieved from sources like Yahoo Finance. The dataset includes:

Date

Open Price

High Price

Low Price

Close Price

Volume

Models Implemented

Random Forest - A tree-based ensemble model used for regression.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - A recurrent neural network (RNN) model effective for time series forecasting.

Gradient Boosting - A boosting algorithm that optimizes prediction accuracy through iterative learning.

Results

The models were evaluated based on metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)

Comparative analysis showed the strengths and weaknesses of each model in stock price prediction.

Installation & Usage
