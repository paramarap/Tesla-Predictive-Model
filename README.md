### Tesla Stock Prediction

This project applies predictive modeling techniques to forecast Tesla's stock price using three machine learning models: Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and XGBoost. Through Python and SQL, I analyzed the relationship between trading volume and price movements, achieving an average prediction accuracy of ~80%.

## Project Overview âœ…
- Stock price prediction using machine learning models
- Manual analysis of Tesla's volatility and market behavior 
- Hypothesis-driven approach on model effectiveness
- SQL analysis to highlight key dates and events
- Research-backed insights explaining stock spikes and dips

## Results & Insights

ðŸ“ˆ The models performed well, with an average accuracy of 80%, indicating a strong learning approach rather than mere memorization.

ðŸ“Š A detailed report is available in the main branch, covering:
- Breakdown of model performance and reasoning behind their effectiveness
- SQL insights on key trading dates
- Market research to understand Tesla's stock volatility
